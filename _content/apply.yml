    You must be a citizen of the United States to work at USDS. On top of that, you'll need to pass a background check and a drug test.

    During the COVID-19 pandemic, most people at USDS are working under a distributed model, from many locations across the country. During normal times, most of the teams we work with are in the D.C. metro area, so we ask that you make D.C. or the surrounding area your base during the work week.
