        <p>USDS operates on a tour-of-service model, with most people serving for one or two years, and often options to extend up to four years. We'll consider some shorter tours, and time commitments are not binding.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Requirements:</strong>
          You must be a citizen of the United States to work at USDS. On top of that, you'll need to pass a background check and a drug test. During the COVID-19 pandemic, most people at USDS are working under a distributed model, from many locations across the country. During normal times, most of the teams we work with are in the D.C. metro area, so we ask that you make D.C. or the surrounding area your base during the work week.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Compensation and benefits:</strong>
Salaries for digital service experts at USDS vary, but don't exceed $170,800, determined by your experience and qualifications. We provide health care and other benefits, such as retirement savings account eligibility. For a wealth of information and different benefit plans offered look on the <a href="https://www.opm.gov/healthcare-insurance/healthcare/plan-information/plans/">OPM website</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Hiring process:</strong>
          Our talent team will be with you every step of the way through your government hiring odyssey. First, complete the application and attach your resume (and portfolio, if you're a designer!). A member of the talent team will be in touch within two weeks after you apply. People who are invited to the interview process will connect with a member of the talent team over the phone, after which you'll complete interviews to assess for skills important to our communities of practice. If selected, your talent partner will work with you to match you to a project.</p>

          <p>Onboarding to USDS can take several weeks, and sometimes longer depending on the background check. Your talent partner will keep you up-to-date throughout.</p>

          <p>If you aren't selected to join USDS, you can apply again after one year with an updated resume.
