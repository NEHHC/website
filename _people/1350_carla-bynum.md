**What’s your background?**

Prior to joining the USDS at DHS team, I provided administrative support for various offices within the General Services Administration. Nine years ago, I started out supporting the GSA American Recovery Act office where I worked in the Limited Scopes office. I spent a bulk of my time with GSA supporting their Field Office and Opportunities Center at St. Elizabeths campus where we provided workforce development opportunities to residents in Ward 8. I then moved to the GSA maintenance office at the Nebraska Avenue Complex.

**What inspired you to join USDS?**

Community-service has always been a passion of mine and I was heavily involved in community service and outreach efforts at my previous job. I was attracted to USDS because of the focus on people-centered development. I love that USDS is intentional about selecting projects and is dedicated to helping underrepresented communities, such as veterans and immigrants.

**What do you want to do after USDS?**

I would love to continue working on people-centered projects that benefit communities that are oftentimes overlooked.

**What will you miss most about USDS when you leave?**

I will miss the family vibe USDS has. Everyone that I’ve interacted with has been super friendly and work to actively counteract stereotypes we often encounter around public servants.
