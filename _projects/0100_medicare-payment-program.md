## The Challenge

Medicare pays for the healthcare of 57 million Americans. The systems that power Medicare process over $500 billion in claims each year. It’s also 40-years-old, runs on 10.5 million lines of COBOL and assembly language, and is shackled to mainframe computers. Every day, 10,000 more people depend on this system. It’s too big to fail.

## The Solution

We’re partnering with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services to stand up a new cloud environment to continue processing claims. A new cloud environment positions Medicare systems to scale and flex rapidly with how CMS processes claims and pays providers, transforming technology from a policy inhibitor to a multipier. The Medicare system has singular importance in determining of how healthcare is provided in the United States.
